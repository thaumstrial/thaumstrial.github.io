Some exercise solutions for John M. Lee Introduction to Topological Manifolds Second Edition
## 2 Topological Spaces
### Exercise 2.4
#### (a)
- Suppose $d$ and $d'$ generate the same topology.

    For every $x\in M,r>0$.

    Because $d$ and $d'$ generate the same topology.
    $B_r^{(d)}(x)$ is open in the topology induced by b, and it is also open in the topology induced by $d'$.

    By the definition of openness in the $d'$-topology,
    > A subset $A \subseteq M$ is said to be an open subset of $M$ if it contains an open ball around each of its points.

    For every point $x\in B_r^{(d)}(x)$, there exists some $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d)}(x)$.

    This gives the first inclusion.
    
    ---
    Similarly, $B_r^{(d')}(x)$ is open in the $d'$-topology and hence also open in the $d$-topology.

    Thus there exists some $r_2>0$ such $B_{r_2}^{(d)}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d')}(x)$

    This gives the second inclusion.
    
    ---
    Both inclusions are obtained and the inclusion property holds for every $x\in M$ and $r>0$.
- Suppose $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d)}(x)$ and $B_{r_2}^{(d)}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d')}(x)$.
    Let $T_d$ denote the topology generated by $d$ and $T_{d'}$ the topology generated by $d'$.

    The goal is to prove that $T_d=T_{d'}$.
    By the antisymmetry of $\subseteq$, the goal can be written as $T_d\subseteq T_{d'}\land T_{d'}\subseteq T_{d}$.

    Let $U\in T_d$ and take any $x\in U$.
    By the definition of open set in the metric topology, there exists $r>0$ such that $B_r^{(d)}(x)\subseteq U$.

    According to the assumption, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d)}(x)\subseteq U$.

    Thus every point $x\in U$ also has a $d'$-ball around it contained in $U$. Therefore $U$ is also open in the $d'$-topology.

    Hence $U\in T_{d'}$, proving $T_d\subseteq T_{d'}$

    ---
    Similarly, let $V\in T_{d'}$ and $x\in V$. Then there exists $r>0$ such that $B^{(d')}_r(x)\subseteq V$. By the assumption, there exists $r_2>0$ such that $B_{r_2}^{(d)}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d')}(x)$.

    Thus $V$ is also open in the $d$-topology, proving $T_{d'}\subseteq T_d$.
    
    ---
    Both inclusions hold, so $T_d=T_{d'}$.
    $$\square$$
#### (b)
Let $T_d$ denote the topology generated by $d$ and $T_{d'}$ the topology generated by $d'$.

Let $U\in T_d$ and take any $u\in U$, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u)\subseteq U$.
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in M : d(u,y)<r_1\}
$$


Let $V\in T_{d'}$ and take any $v\in V$, there exists $r_2>0$ such that $B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)\subseteq V$.
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in M : d'(v,y)<r_2\}
$$

---
Now substitute $d'(v,y)=c\cdot d(v,y)$,
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in M : d'(v,y)<r_2\} = \{y\in M : c\cdot d(v,y)<r_2\}
$$
Divide both sides by $c>0$,
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in M : d(v,y)<r_2/c\} = B_{r_2/c}^{(d)}(v)
$$

Hence for any $v\in V$ there exists $B_{r_2/c}^{(d)}(v)\subseteq V$, proving $V\in T_d$.
Namely $T_{d'}\subseteq T_{d}$.

---
Similarly, substitute $d(u,y)= d'(u,y)/c$,
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in M : d(u,y)<r_1\} = \{y\in M : d'(u,y)/c<r_1\}
$$
Multiply both sides by $c$,
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in M : d'(u,y)<r_1\cdot c\} = B_{c\cdot r_1}^{(d')}(u)
$$

Hence for any $u\in U$ there exists $B_{c\cdot r_1}^{(d')}(u)\subseteq U$, proving $U\in T_{d'}$.
Namely $T_{d}\subseteq T_{d'}$.

Combining both inclusions, get $T_d=T_{d'}$.
$$\square$$
#### (c)

Let $T_d$ denote the topology generated by the Euclidean metric and $T_{d'}$ the topology generated by $d'$. 

---
Let $U\in T_d$ and take any $u\in U$, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u)\subseteq U$.
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in \mathbb{R}^n : d(u,y)<r_1\}
$$

Let $V\in T_{d'}$ and take any $v\in V$, there exists $r_2>0$ such that $B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)\subseteq V$.
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in \mathbb{R}^n : d'(v,y)<r_2\}
$$
---

To compare these two topologies, relation between the two metrics is desired.

We can prove the following inequalities.
$$
d'(x,y)\leq d(x,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(x,y)
$$

- $d'(x,y)\leq d(x,y)$

    By the definition of Euclidean metric,
    $$
        d(x,y)^2=\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2
    $$
    Every term $(x_i-y_i)^2$ is nonnegative, so for any term $j$,
    $$
        (x_j-y_j)^2\leq \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2=d(x,y)^2
    $$
    Now take the square root of both sides (valid since both sides are $\ge 0$)
    $$
        |x_j-y_j|\leq d(x,y)
    $$
    Because $j$ can be any coordinate, substitute by $d'$ is valid.

    $$
        d'(x,y)\leq d(x,y)
    $$
- $d(x,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(x,y)$

    For every coordinate $i$, $|x_i-y_i|\leq d'(x,y)$ by the definition of $d'$.

    Squaring and then summing over all coordinates gives
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-y_i)^2\leq n \cdot (d'(x,y))^2
    $$

    Now take square roots (both sides are nonnegative):

    $$
    d(x,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(x,y)
    $$
---
For each $y\in B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)$, $d'(v,y)<r_2$ by definition.

Then apply above inequalities, 

$$

d(v,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(v,y)< \sqrt{n}r_2

$$

That is $y\in B_{\sqrt{n}r_2}^{(d)}(v)$. Namely $B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)\subseteq B_{\sqrt{n}r_2}^{(d)}(v)$.

Therefore, for each $v\in V$, there exists $r'_2>0$ (take $r'_2=\sqrt{n}r_2$) such that $B_{r'_2}^{(d)}(v)\subseteq V$.

---
Similarly, if $d(u,y)<r_1$ then $d'(u,y)\leq d(u,y)<r_1$.

That is $B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u)\subseteq B_{r_1}^{(d')}(u)$.

Therefore, for each $u\in U$, there exists $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(u)\subseteq U$.

---
Both inclusions hold, get $T_d=T_{d'}$.
$$
\square
$$
#### (d)
It suffices to show that if every singleton is in the topology, the topology must be the discrete topology, because arbitrary unions of singletons can generate entire power set.

For any $x\in X$ and $r>0$,
- $r\leq 1$
    
    Since $d(x,y)<r\leq 1$ can only ocurr     when $x=y$ by the definition of discrete metric.
    $$B_r^{(d)}(x)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<r\}=\{x\}$$

- $r>1$
    
    Then $d(x,y)<r$ holds for all $y\in X$, because $d(x,y)$ is always $1$ or $0$.

    So $B_r^{(d)}(x)=X$.

Any subset $A\subseteq X$ can be written as a union of singletons,
$$
A=\bigcup_{x\in  A}{x}
$$

Since any singleton is open and the unions of open sets are still open, every subset of $X$ is open and $d$ generates the discrete topology.
$$
\square
$$
#### (e)
By Exercise 2.4 (c), discrete metric generates the discrete topology.

It suffices to show that Euclidean metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$ also generates the discrete topology on $\mathbb{Z}$.

For $x\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $r>0$,

$$
B_r^{(d)}(x)=\{y\in\mathbb{Z}:|x-y|<r\}
$$

Now consider different ranges of $r$,
- $r\leq 1$
    
    The only integer $y$ satisfying $|x-y|<1$ is $x-y$.
    So $B_r^{(d)}(x)=\{x\}$.
- $r>1$
    
    Because it has already been proved that every singleton is open, $d$ generates the discrete topology on $\mathbb{Z}$.

Therefore, both metrics generate the same (discrete) topology.
$$
\square
$$
### Exercise 2.5
Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the topology on $X$ and $\mathcal{T}_Y$ be the topology on $Y$.

Three axioms of topology space must be hold.
- $\emptyset,Y\in \mathcal{T}_Y$
    
    Since $\emptyset\in\mathcal{T}$ and $\emptyset\subseteq Y$, $\emptyset\in \mathcal{T}_Y$.

    $Y\in \mathcal{T}$ by the given assumption and $Y\subseteq Y$, so $Y\in \mathcal{T}_Y$.
- $\mathcal{T}_Y$ is closed under arbitary unions.

    Let $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ be any collection of sets in $\mathcal{T}_Y$.
    Each $U_i$ is open in $X$ and contained in $Y$ by the definition of $\mathcal{T}_Y$. Then
    $$
    \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i
    $$
    is a union of open sets in $X$, hence open in $X$, and clearly contained in $Y$ because each $U_i\in Y$.

    Thus $\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\in\mathcal{T}_Y$.
- $\mathcal{T}_Y$ is closed under finite intersections.
    
    Let $U_1,U_2,\dots,U_n\in \mathcal{T}_Y$.
    Each $U_i\in \mathcal{T}$ and $U_i\subseteq Y$. Then
    $$
    \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i
    $$
    is a finite intersection of open sets in $X$, hence open in $X$, and also contained in $Y$. Therefore 
    $$
    \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \mathcal{T}_Y
    $$
All topology axioms are satisfied, so $\mathcal{T}_Y=\{U\subseteq Y:U\in \mathcal{T}\}$ is a topology on $Y$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.6
- $\emptyset,Y\in \mathcal{T}$
    
    Since each $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is a topology, $\emptyset,X\in\mathcal{T}_\alpha$. Hence $\emptyset,X\in\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}\mathcal{T}_\alpha=\mathcal{T}$.
- $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitary unions.
    
    Let $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ be any collection of sets in $\mathcal{T}$. Then $U_i\in\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in A$. Because ${T}_\alpha$ is a topology,
    $$\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\in\mathcal{T}_\alpha$$
    Since this holds for every $\alpha$,
    $$
    \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\in\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}\mathcal{T}_\alpha=\mathcal{T}
    $$

    Therefore, $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitary unions.
- $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersections.
    
    Let $U_1,U_2,\dots,U_n\in \mathcal{T}$. Then $U_i\in \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in A$ and $1\leq i\leq n$.

    Since each $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is a topology,

    $$\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i\in\mathcal{T}_\alpha$$

    Hence  
    $$
    \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i\in\bigcap_{\alpha\in A}\mathcal{T}_\alpha=\mathcal{T}
    $$

    So $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersections.

All topology axioms hold. Therefore $\mathcal{T}=\bigcap_{\alpha\in A}\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is a topology on $X$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.9
#### (a)
- Suppose $x\in \text{Int}\;A$.

    By definition of the interior, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x\in U \subseteq A$.

    Because $U$ is open and contains $x$, $U$ is a neighborhood $x$. Namely $x$ has a neighborhood contained in $A$.
- Suppose $x$ has a neighborhood contained in $A$.

    That means that there exists an open set $U$ such that $x\in U \subseteq A$. Then any such $U$ is part of the union that forms $\text{Int}\;A$ by the definition.

    Hence $x\in\text{Int}\;A$.
$$\square$$
#### (b)
- Suppose $x\in \text{Ext}\;A$.

    By definition, $x\in X$ and $x\notin\overline{A}$, which means that there exists a closed set $B,B\supseteq A$ and $x\notin B$.

    Then there must exists an open set $U$ containing $x$ and $U\subseteq X\setminus A$. Thus $x$ has a neighborhood $U$ contained in $X\setminus A$.
- Suppose $x$ has a neighborhood contained in $X\setminus A$.
    
    That is, there exists an open set $U$ with $x\in U\subseteq X\setminus A$. Then $U\cap A=\emptyset$, so there exists a closed set that is a super set of $A$ and not containing $x$, resulting in $x\notin \overline{A}$.

    Therefore $x\in X\setminus\overline{A}=\text{Ext}\;A$.
$$\square$$
#### (c)
- Suppose $x\in\partial A$.
    
    By definition, $x\in X$, $x\notin \text{Int}\; A$ and $x\notin \text{Ext}\; A$.
    
    Since $x\notin \text{Int}\; A$, by Exercise 2.9 (a), $x$ has no neighborhood contained entirely in $A$.
    Therefore, every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $X\setminus A$.

    Since $x\notin \text{Ext}\; A$, by by Exercise 2.9 (b), $x$ has no neighborhood contained entirely in $X\setminus A$.
    Therefore, every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$.

    Combining these two facts, every neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one point of $A$ and one point of $X\setminus A$.
- Suppose every neighborhood of $x$ meets both $A$ and $X\setminus A$.
    
    Then no neighborhood of $x$ can be contained in $A$, which means $x\notin \textbf{Int}\; A$.
    And no neighborhood of $x$ can be contained in $X\setminus A$, which means $x\notin \textbf{Ext}\; A$.

    Thus $x\in X\setminus (\textbf{Int}\; A\cup \textbf{Ext}\; A)$.
$$\square$$
#### (d)
- Suppose $x\in\overline{A}$.
    
    By definition, $x$ is in every closed set $B$ that is a superset of $A$.

    Now take any neighborhood $U$ of $x$. Its complement $X\setminus U$ is closed and does not contain $x$. Assume that $U\cap A=\emptyset$, then $A\subseteq X\setminus U$, and $X\setminus U$ is a closed set containing $A$ but not $x$. That would contradict $x\in\overline{A}$, since $x$ must be in every closed set containing $A$. Hence $U\cap A\neq\emptyset$.

    So every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains at least one point of $A$.
- Suppose every neighborhood of $x$ meets $A$.
    
    Let $B$ be any closed set with $A\subseteq B$, then $X\setminus B$ is open and disjoint from $A$.
    
    Assume that $x\notin B$ for some $B$, then $x\in X\setminus B$, which is a neighborhood of $x$ disjoint from $A$. But this contradicts the assumption that every neighborhood of $x$ meets $A$. Therefore, $x\in B$ for every such closed $B$.

    That means $x$ lies in the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$. Namely, $x\in\overline{A}$.
$$\square$$
#### (e)
$x\in\overline{A}$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ meets $A$, by Exercise 2.9 (d).

$x\in\partial A$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ meets both $A$ and $X\setminus A$, by Exercise 2.9 (c).

$x\in\text{Int}\; A$ if and only if some neighborhood of $x$ lies in $A$, by Exercise 2.9 (a).

Then
$$\overline{A}=\text{Int}\; A\cup\{x:\text{every neighborhood meets }A \text{ but not contained in } A\}$$
and the second set equals to $\partial A$. Hence $\overline{A}=\text{Int}\; A\cup\partial A$.

Since $\text{Int}\; A\subseteq A\subseteq \overline{A}$ and $\partial A\subseteq\overline{A}$, the same argument yeilds $\overline{A}=A\cup\partial A$.

Thus both equalities hold.
$$\square$$
#### (f)
$\text{Int}\; A$ is a union of open sets, so it is open.

$\text{Ext}\; A$ is the complement of closed set, so it is open.

$\overline{A}$ is an intersection of closed sets. so it is closed.

$\partial A$ is the complement of open set, so it is closed.
$$\square$$

#### (g)

- $A$ is open $\leftrightarrow$ $\text{Int}\; A$
  
    If $A$ is open, by definition of interior, $A$ itself is open and contained in $A$. Thus $\text{Int}\; A=A$. 

    If $\text{Int}\; A=A$, and $\text{Int}\; A$ is open by Exercise 2.9 (f), then $A$ is open.
- $A$ is open $\leftrightarrow$ $A$ contains none of its boundary points

    If $A$ is open, then $\text{Int}\; A=A$, so
    $$
        \partial A = X\setminus(\text{Int}\; A\cup \text{Ext}\; A)=X\setminus(A\cup \text{Ext}\; A)\\
        \partial A\cap A = \emptyset
    $$

    By Exercise 2.9 (e), $\overline{A}=A\cup\partial A$. Since $\partial A\cap A = \emptyset$, $\partial A=\overline{A}\setminus A$. Hence no point of $A$ lies in $\partial A$.

    Conversely, if $A$ contains no boundary points, then $A\cap\partial A=\emptyset$. Since $\overline{A}=A\cup\partial A=\text{Int}\; A\cup\partial A$, $A\subseteq\text{Int}\; A$. But alwyas $\text{Int}\; A\subseteq A$ by Exercise 2.9 (e), so $A=\text{Int}\; A$, and thus $A$ is open.

- $A$ is open $\leftrightarrow$ Every point of $A$ has a neighborhood contained in $A$

    If $A$ is open, it is itself a neighborhood of each of its points. So each $x\in A$ has a neighborhood $A$ contained in $A$.

    If every point of $A$ has a neighborhood $U_x\subseteq A$, then $A=\bigcup_{x\in A}U_x$, a union of open sets, hence open.
$$\square$$
#### (h)
- $A$ is closed $\leftrightarrow A=\overline{A}$

    If $A$ is closed, $A$ itself is a closed set containing $A$, and its intersection with any larger closed set containing $A$ is still A. So $A=\overline{A}$.

    If $A=\overline{A}$, since $\overline{A}$ is always closed by Exercise 2.9 (f), $A$ is closed.
- $A$ is closed $\leftrightarrow$ $A$ contains all its boundary points
    
    If $A$ is closed, then $\overline{A}=A$, hence $\overline{A}=A\cup\partial A=\overline{A}\cup\partial A$, which implies that $\partial A\subseteq A$. So $A$ contains all its boundary points.

    If $A$ contains all its boundary points, then $\partial A\subseteq A$, hence $\overline{A}=A\cup\partial A=A$. So $A$ is closed.
- $A$ is closed $\leftrightarrow$ Every point of $X\setminus A$ has a neighborhood contained in $X\setminus A$

    If $A$ is closed, then $X\setminus A$ is open. So for each $x\in X\setminus A$, the set $X\setminus A$ itself is an open neighborhood of $x$ and the set itself contained in $X\setminus A$. Hence every point of $X\setminus A$ has a neighborhood contained in $X\setminus A$.

    If every $x\in X\setminus A$ has a neighborhood (open set $U_x$) contained in $X\setminus A$, then
    $$
        X\setminus A=\bigcup_{x\in X\setminus A}U_x
    $$
    is open because the union of open sets is open, implying $A$ is closed.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.10
- Suppose $A$ is closed.

    Let $x$ be a limit point of $A$. Assume that $x\notin A$ for some $x$. Then $x\in X\setminus A$, which is open. So there exists a neighborhood $U\subseteq X\setminus A$ of $x$. But then $U\cap A=\emptyset$, contradicting the definition of limit point. Hence $x\in A$. 
- Suppose $A$ contains all of its limit points.

    Let $x\in X\setminus A$. Since $x\notin A$ and $x$ is not a limit point of $A$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U\cap A=\emptyset$. Then $U\subseteq X\setminus A$, so every point of $X\setminus A$ has an open neighborhood contained in it. Hence $X\setminus A$ is open, and $A$ is closed.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.11
- Suppose a subset $A\subseteq X$ is dense.

    That is $\overline{A}=X$. Let $U\subseteq X$ be a nonempty open set. For any $x\in U$, since $x\in\overline{A}$, every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ by Exercise 2.8 (d). In particular, $U$ itself is a neighborhood of $x$. Hence $U\cap A\neq\emptyset$. So $U$ contains a point of $A$.

- Suppose every nonempty open subset of $X$ contains a point of $A$.
    
    Let $x\in X$. Every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ is open and nonempty, so $U$ contains a point of $A$. Thus every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$, meaning $x\in\overline{A}$. Thus $\overline{A}=X$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.12
Let $\mathcal{T}_d$ be the topology induced by the metric $d$ in a metric space.

- Suppose $x_i\to x$ in the metric space.

    For any open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in the topology $\mathcal{T}_d$. By definition of $\mathcal{T}_d$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that the open ball 
    $$
    B_\varepsilon(x)=\{y\in X:d(x,y)<\varepsilon\}
    $$
    is contained in $U$. By metric convergence, there exists $N$ such that $i\ge N\implies d(x_i,x)<\varepsilon$. 
    
    Hence $x_i\in B_\varepsilon(x)\subseteq U$ for all $i\ge N$. Thus $x_i\to x$ in the topology sense.

- Suppose $x_i\to x$ in the topology space.
  
    Fix $\varepsilon>0$. The ball $B_\varepsilon(x)$ is open in $\mathcal{T}_d$, hence a neighborhood of $x$. By topological convergence, there exists $N$ such that $i\ge N\implies x_i\in B_\varepsilon(x_i)$, namely $d(x_i, x)<\varepsilon$. Thus $x_i\to x$ in the metric sense.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.13
- Suppose $x_i\to x$ in $X$.

    Then $\{x\}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ since $X$ is a discrete topology space. By the definition of convergence, there exists $N$ such that $i\geq N\implies x_i\in\{x\}$. That is $x_i=x$ for all $i\ge N$. Hence the sequence is eventually constant.

- Suppose $(x_i)$ is eventually constant.
    
    That is there exists $N$ such that $x_i=x$ for all $i\ge N$. Then for any open set $U$ containing $x$, $x_i=x\in U$ holds for all $i\ge N$. Therefore $x_i\to x$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.14
Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of $x$. Since $x_i\to x$, by the definition of convergence, there exists $N$ such that $i\ge N\implies x_i\in U$. Each $x_i\in A$ by hypothesis, so $x_i\in A\cap U$ for all $i\ge N$. Thus every neighborhood of $x$ meets $A$. By Exercise 2.9 (d), it follows that $x\in\overline{A}$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.16
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a map between topological spaces.
- Suppose $f$ is continuous.
    
    For any closed set $C\subseteq Y$. Then $Y\setminus C$ is open in $Y$. By continuity of $f$, the preimage $f^{-1}(Y\setminus C)$ is open in $X$.

    By the preimage law 
    $$
        f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) = X\setminus f^{-1}(C)
    $$
    Since $X\setminus f^{-1}(C)$ is open, $f^{-1}(C)$ must be closed in $X$. Hence preimages of closed sets are closed.

- Suppose the preimage of every closed subset is closed.

    That is, for every closed set $C\subseteq Y$, the set $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $X$. Then $Y\setminus C$ is open in $Y$. Similarly
    $$
        f^{-1}(Y\setminus C) = X\setminus f^{-1}(C)
    $$
    Because $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed, its complement $X\setminus f^{-1}(C)$ is open.
    Thus preimages of open sets are open, proving $f$ is continuous.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.18
#### (a)
Let $f(x)=c$ for some fixed $x\in Y$, and $U$ is any open set in $Y$. Then 
$$
f^{-1}(U)=\begin{cases}
    X,\quad &c\in U \\
    \emptyset,\quad &c\notin U
\end{cases}
$$
Both $X$ and $\empty$ are open in $X$. Hence $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for every open set $U\subseteq Y$, proving $f$ is continuous.
#### (b)

For any open set $U\subseteq X$,
$$
\text{Id}_X^{-1}(U)=\{x\in X:\text{Id}_X(x)\in U\}=U
$$
Since $U$ is open and its preimage $U$ is open, $\text{Id}_X$ is continuous.
#### (c)
Let $U\subseteq Y$ be open, and define $f|_U:U\to Y$ by $f|_U(x)=f(x)$.

Let $V\subseteq Y$ be open. By definition of preimage and restrictions:
$$
(f|_U)^{-1}(V)=\{x\in U:f(x)\in V\}=U\cap f^{-1}(V)
$$
Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. Hence the intersection $U\cap f^{-1}(V)$ of two open sets is open in $U$ (by the subspace topology definition). Thus $f|_U$ is continuous.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.20
- Reflexivity

    For every topology space $X$, the identity map
    $$
    \text{id}_X: X\to X,\quad\text{id}_X(x)=x
    $$
    is bijective and continuous, and its inverse is itself (also continuous). Hence $X$ is homeomorphic to itself.

- Symmetry

    Suppose $f:X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism. Then $f$ is bijective, continuous, and $f^{-1}:X\to Y$ is continuous. Therefore $f^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism from $Y$ to $X$. Hence if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, then $Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$.

- Transitivity

    Suppose $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are homeomorphisms. Then both $f$ and $g$ are bijective and continuous, with continuous inverses. The composition 
    $$
    g\circ f: X\to Z
    $$
    is bijective (since a composition of bijections is bijective), continuous (composition of continuous maps is continuous), and has continuous inverse
    $$
    (g\circ f) ^ {-1} = f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}
    $$
    Thus $g\circ f$ is a homeomorphism from $X$ to $Z$. Hence if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$ and $Y$ to $Z$, then $X$ is homeomorphic to $Z$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.22
Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous. Because $f^{-1}$ is continuous, the preimage under $f^{-1}$ of any open set in $X$ is open in $Y$. That is $(f^{-1})^{-1}(U)=f(U)$, which means $f(U)$ is open in $Y$.

---

The next goal is to prove that $f|_U:U\to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism.

- Bijectivity
    
    Since $f$ is bijective, the restriction $f|_U$ is bijective from $U$ onto $f(U)$.

- Continuouity
  
  From Exercise 2.18 (c), the restriction of a continuous map to an open subset of its domain is continuous. Thus $f|_U$ is continuous.

- Inverse Continuouity
  
  The inverse of $f|_U$ is the restriction of $f^{-1}$ to $f(U)$. That is $(f|_U)^{-1}=f^{-1}|_{f(u)}$. Since $f^{-1}$ is continuous and $f(U)$ is open in $Y$, apply Exercise 2.18 (c) again shows that the restriction $f^{-1}|_{f(u)}$ is continuous.

Therefore, $f|_U$ is bijective, continuous, and has a continuous inverse.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.33
Let $\mathcal{T}=\{\emptyset,Y\}$ be the trivial topology of $Y$, $(y_n)$ be any sequence of $Y$, and let $y\in Y$ be any point.

In the trivial topology, the only open set containing $y$ is $Y$ it self. Since $Y$ also contains every term of the sequence, by definition, $y$ is the limit point of sequence $(y_n)$.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.35
Let $p,q\in X,\quad p\neq q$. By assumption, there is a continuous function $f_p:X\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f_p^{-1}(0)={p}$. Since $p\neq q$, $f_p(q)\neq 0$. 

Let 
$$
\varepsilon=\frac{|f_p(q)|}{2} > 0
$$

Define the open sets,

$$
U=f_p^{-1}(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon),\quad V=f_p^{-1}(\mathbb{R}\setminus[-\varepsilon,\varepsilon])
$$

Both sets are open because $f_p$ is continuous. 

Then

- $p\in U$ because $f_p(p)=0\in (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$.

- $q\in V$ because $|f_p(q)|>\varepsilon$.

- $U\cap V=\emptyset$ by construction.

Thus every pair $p\neq q$ is contained in disjoint open neighborhood, proving $X$ is Hausdorff.
$$\square$$
### Exercise 2.54
- Suppose $X$ is a $0$-manifold.

    For each $x\in X$, there exists an open $U_x\subseteq X$ and a homeomorphism $\varphi_x:U_x\to\{0\}$. Since $\varphi_x$ is a homeomorphism and $\{0\}$ is open in itself, $U_x=\varphi_x^{-1}(\{0\})$ is open. But $U_x$ contains exactly one point because $\varphi$ is injective. Hence $U_x=\{x\}$ is open. So $X$ is discrete.
    
    ---
    
    A $0$-manifold is second countable by definition. Therefore a discrete second-countable space must be countable, because a discrete space has the basis $\{\{x\}:x\in X\}$. A basis must be countable, so $X$ must be countable.
    

    
    Thus $X$ is a countable discrete space.
- Suppose $X$ is a discrete countable space.

    In a discrete space, every point $x\in X$ has an open neighborhood $U_x=\{x\}$, which is open. Then the map $\{x\}\to\{0\},\quad x\mapsto 0$ is a homeomorphism onto $\{0\}$. So each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^0$. And a countable discrete space is second countable and Hausdorff.

    Thus $X$ satisfies the definition of a $0$-manifold.
$$\square$$
