## 2 Topological Spaces
### Exercise 2.4
#### (a)
- Suppose $d$ and $d'$ generate the same topology.

    For every $x\in M,r>0$.

    Because $d$ and $d'$ generate the same topology.
    $B_r^{(d)}(x)$ is open in the topology induced by b, and it is also open in the topology induced by $d'$.

    By the definition of openness in the $d'$-topology,
    > A subset $A \subseteq M$ is said to be an open subset of $M$ if it contains an open ball around each of its points.

    For every point $x\in B_r^{(d)}(x)$, there exists some $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d)}(x)$.

    This gives the first inclusion.
    
    ---
    Similarly, $B_r^{(d')}(x)$ is open in the $d'$-topology and hence also open in the $d$-topology.

    Thus there exists some $r_2>0$ such $B_{r_2}^{(d)}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d')}(x)$

    This gives the second inclusion.
    
    ---
    Both inclusions are obtained and the inclusion property holds for every $x\in M$ and $r>0$.
- Suppose $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d)}(x)$ and $B_{r_2}^{(d)}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d')}(x)$.
    Let $T_d$ denote the topology generated by $d$ and $T_{d'}$ the topology generated by $d'$.

    The goal is to prove that $T_d=T_{d'}$.
    By the antisymmetry of $\subseteq$, the goal can be written as $T_d\subseteq T_{d'}\land T_{d'}\subseteq T_{d}$.

    Let $U\in T_d$ and take any $x\in U$.
    By the definition of open set in the metric topology, there exists $r>0$ such that $B_r^{(d)}(x)\subseteq U$.

    According to the assumption, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d)}(x)\subseteq U$.

    Thus every point $x\in U$ also has a $d'$-ball around it contained in $U$. Therefore $U$ is also open in the $d'$-topology.

    Hence $U\in T_{d'}$, proving $T_d\subseteq T_{d'}$

    ---
    Similarly, let $V\in T_{d'}$ and $x\in V$. Then there exists $r>0$ such that $B^{(d')}_r(x)\subseteq V$. By the assumption, there exists $r_2>0$ such that $B_{r_2}^{(d)}(x)\subseteq B_r^{(d')}(x)$.

    Thus $V$ is also open in the $d$-topology, proving $T_{d'}\subseteq T_d$.
    
    ---
    Both inclusions hold, so $T_d=T_{d'}$.
    $$\square$$
### (b)
Let $T_d$ denote the topology generated by $d$ and $T_{d'}$ the topology generated by $d'$.

Let $U\in T_d$ and take any $u\in U$, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u)\subseteq U$.
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in M : d(u,y)<r_1\}
$$


Let $V\in T_{d'}$ and take any $v\in V$, there exists $r_2>0$ such that $B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)\subseteq V$.
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in M : d'(v,y)<r_2\}
$$

---
Now substitute $d'(v,y)=c\cdot d(v,y)$,
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in M : d'(v,y)<r_2\} = \{y\in M : c\cdot d(v,y)<r_2\}
$$
Divide both sides by $c>0$,
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in M : d(v,y)<r_2/c\} = B_{r_2/c}^{(d)}(v)
$$

Hence for any $v\in V$ there exists $B_{r_2/c}^{(d)}(v)\subseteq V$, proving $V\in T_d$.
Namely $T_{d'}\subseteq T_{d}$.

---
Similarly, substitute $d(u,y)= d'(u,y)/c$,
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in M : d(u,y)<r_1\} = \{y\in M : d'(u,y)/c<r_1\}
$$
Multiply both sides by $c$,
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in M : d'(u,y)<r_1\cdot c\} = B_{c\cdot r_1}^{(d')}(u)
$$

Hence for any $u\in U$ there exists $B_{c\cdot r_1}^{(d')}(u)\subseteq U$, proving $U\in T_{d'}$.
Namely $T_{d}\subseteq T_{d'}$.

Combining both inclusions, get $T_d=T_{d'}$.
$$\square$$
### (c)

Let $T_d$ denote the topology generated by the Euclidean metric and $T_{d'}$ the topology generated by $d'$. 

---
Let $U\in T_d$ and take any $u\in U$, there exists $r_1>0$ such that $B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u)\subseteq U$.
$$
B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u) = \{y\in \mathbb{R}^n : d(u,y)<r_1\}
$$

Let $V\in T_{d'}$ and take any $v\in V$, there exists $r_2>0$ such that $B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)\subseteq V$.
$$
B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v) = \{y\in \mathbb{R}^n : d'(v,y)<r_2\}
$$
---

To compare these two topologies, relation between the two metrics is desired.

We can prove the following inequalities.
$$
d'(x,y)\leq d(x,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(x,y)
$$

- $d'(x,y)\leq d(x,y)$

    By the definition of Euclidean metric,
    $$
        d(x,y)^2=\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2
    $$
    Every term $(x_i-y_i)^2$ is nonnegative, so for any term $j$,
    $$
        (x_j-y_j)^2\leq \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2=d(x,y)^2
    $$
    Now take the square root of both sides (valid since both sides are $\ge 0$)
    $$
        |x_j-y_j|\leq d(x,y)
    $$
    Because $j$ can be any coordinate, substitute by $d'$ is valid.

    $$
        d'(x,y)\leq d(x,y)
    $$
- $d(x,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(x,y)$

    For every coordinate $i$, $|x_i-y_i|\leq d'(x,y)$ by the definition of $d'$.

    Squaring and then summing over all coordinates gives
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-y_i)^2\leq n \cdot (d'(x,y))^2
    $$

    Now take square roots (both sides are nonnegative):

    $$
    d(x,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(x,y)
    $$
---
For each $y\in B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)$, $d'(v,y)<r_2$ by definition.

Then apply above inequalities, 

$$

d(v,y)\leq\sqrt{n}d'(v,y)< \sqrt{n}r_2

$$

That is $y\in B_{\sqrt{n}r_2}^{(d)}(v)$. Namely $B_{r_2}^{(d')}(v)\subseteq B_{\sqrt{n}r_2}^{(d)}(v)$.

Therefore, for each $v\in V$, there exists $r'_2>0$ (take $r'_2=\sqrt{n}r_2$) such that $B_{r'_2}^{(d)}(v)\subseteq V$.

---
Similarly, if $d(u,y)<r_1$ then $d'(u,y)\leq d(u,y)<r_1$.

That is $B_{r_1}^{(d)}(u)\subseteq B_{r_1}^{(d')}(u)$.

Therefore, for each $u\in U$, there exists $B_{r_1}^{(d')}(u)\subseteq U$.

---
Both inclusions hold, get $T_d=T_{d'}$.
